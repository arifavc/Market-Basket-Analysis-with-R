# Apriori Algorithm
  
**Apriori algorithm,** a classic algorithm, is useful in mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. Usually, you operate this algorithm on a database containing a large number of transactions. One such example is the items customers buy at a supermarket.

It helps the customers buy their items with ease, and enhances the sales performance of the departmental store.

This algorithm also has utility in the field of healthcare as it can help in detecting adverse drug reactions (ADR) by producing association rules to indicate the combination of medications and patient characteristics that could lead to ADRs.


I implemented this algorithm to over 10,000 sample transactions on the Groceries dataset in R.
